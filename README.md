rmit-rendering
==============

Source repository for my project in the course [Real-Time Rendering & 3D Games Programming](http://goanna.cs.rmit.edu.au/~gl/teaching/rtr&3dgp/) @ [RMIT](http://www.rmit.edu.au/) by [Geoff Leach](http://goanna.cs.rmit.edu.au/~gl/).

The project involves implementing an application capabable of rendering various 3D scenes using OpenGL 4.2. My goal is to implement as many of the features listed below before the end of semester 2 of 2013:

* Model loading with ASSIMP ✓
* Fly-through scene camera ✓
* Color, specular and normal/bump-map textures ✓
* Fully deferred rendering ✓
* Screen-space ambient occlusion ✓
* CPU raytracing using spatial tree optimizations ✓
* Basic physics
* Portal rendering

The application runs exclusively on GNU/Linux with modern (OpenGL/GLSL 4.2+) graphics hardware and drivers.

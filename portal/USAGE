This document explains the usage of the "portal" engine demo by SÃ¸ren V. Poulsen.

From the project root directory (the directory this file resides in) execute the program from the shell (e.g. "bin/portal").

Move around the scene using WASD+mouse controls. Use the space bar for upward movement, CTRL for downward. Holding down shift doubles the movement speed. Exit the application by pressing ESC.

Keybindings:
WASD = Movement keys
Space = Up
CTRL = Down
Shift (hold) = Double movement speed
ESC = Exit application

N = Toggle lighting
B = Toggle bump/normal-mapping
V = Toggle ambient occlusion

<Display modes>
1 = Full shading
2 = Depth display
3 = Normals display
4 = Albedo/texture color
5 = Ambient occlusion
6 = Positions (mostly for debugging)

<Debugging features>
Mouse1 = Shoot ray
Shift+1 = Toggle BVH display
Shift+2 = Toggle debug lines/rays
Shift+3 = Toggle crosshairs
